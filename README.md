First assigment for seccond year of frontend devolement on Noroff.
Our task was to build a client-side social media application. This application will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Destroy/Delete) on their own posts as well as allow for additional features, such as following/unfollowing users, commenting on posts and reacting to a post with an emoji.

Styling was not part of the task this time, so the page/app lacks styling for now.

The project is build with html, css and javaScript.
The project is also set up with Vite template using Vanilla JavaScript settings, using MPA (Multi-page application) mode.
